# Calico DOM Utilities

This project, Calico DOM Utilities, 
is a comprehensive toolkit designed to facilitate unit testing in the Calico environment. 
It offers utilities that are specifically tailored to interact with and test the individual components of Calico.

The structure and approach of our unit tests draw inspiration from the unit cases of Laminar, 
a Scala library for building reactive user interfaces.

Calico is built upon the `cats-effect` library, which is a powerful tool for writing asynchronous, concurrent, and resource-safe code in Scala. 
In line with this, we utilize `munit-cats-effect` for our unit testing needs, 
providing seamless integration between the `munit` Scala testing framework and `cats-effect`.

Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements to our utilities. 
Your feedback and contributions are always welcome!
